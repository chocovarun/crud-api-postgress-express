# This CRUD API will help to create a CRUD RESTful API in a Node.js environment 
# running on an Express.js server and using a PostgreSQL database. 
# This will connect an Express.js server with PostgreSQL using node-postgres. 
# The API will be able to handle the HTTP request methods that correspond to the PostgreSQL DB from which the API gets its data.

# My objective is to learn to perform CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) on the API, 
# which will run several database commands from queries.js. 
# To do these commands, I'll set up a route for each endpoint and a function for each query.
